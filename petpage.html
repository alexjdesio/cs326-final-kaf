                                Sparky is a Boston Terrier mixed with an unknown breed of hound.
                                He was abandoned when he was just 6 months old, and was rescued a few weeks later when a friend
                                of the shelter found him sleeping on a street corner. He is now one year old. Even after his sad upbringing, Sparky is 
                                a joyous, energetic and playful dog. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text bg-light">
                                Since his rescue, he has regained a healthy weight and coat of 
                                fur, but he still has some extra needs for love and attention. 
                                If you wish to adopt Sparky, make sure you read up on his health concerns--he may be at a proper 
                                weight, but he requires some extra care from his future owners.
