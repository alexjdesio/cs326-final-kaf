                            <p class="card-text bg-light">Sparky is a Boston Terrier mixed with an unknown breed of hound.
                                He was abandoned when he was just 6 months old, and was rescued a few weeks later when a friend
                                of the shelter found him sleeping on a street corner. Even after his sad upbringing, Sparky is 
                                a joyous, energetic and playful dog. Since his rescue, he has regained a healthy weight and coat of 
                                fur, but he still has some extra needs for love and attention.
