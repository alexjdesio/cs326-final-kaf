# Innovative Idea
A pet adoption web app that enables both animal shelters and rescuers to find homes for their pets. They are able to upload their database and digital media (pictures, videos, and virtual meetings). As for the adopters, they are able to publicly comment or directly message posters regarding one of their pets. 
There is a similar web app called Petfinder. While the website has a vast user base and many pets to view, it relies on the use of email and phones to unite pets with their adopters. We want to create an app similar to that but change the game in how users can “meet” the pets via videos and virtual meetings.

# Important Components
An important feature is the built in messaging system in our app. By providing a seamless interaction between adopters and animal shelters, it can relieve some of the hassles of Emails and calls. Behind this messaging system will have to be user profiles, which will need to be divided into two types. One will be the more common way to use the website, as an adopter. The other will be the profiles of animal shelters. Both will have different needs and will therefore have different user interfaces.

Another one, the virtual meetings, asynchronous or synchronous, will allow adopters to meet the pets without leaving their homes. Synchronous will utilize Zoom (subject to change), and asynchronous will utilize Youtube (subject to change).
